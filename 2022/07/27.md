That there's a `npm outdated` command that finds packages which are not at their most recent versions!
Example:

```sh
npm outdated --global
# Package  Current   Wanted   Latest  Location
# n          7.5.0    7.5.0    9.0.0  global
# npm      6.14.15  6.14.17   8.15.0  global
# pnpm      6.15.2   6.33.1    7.6.0  global
# yarn     1.22.11  1.22.19  1.22.19  global
```

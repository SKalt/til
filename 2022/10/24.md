That you can list all addresses in terraform state by running
```sh
terraform state list
```

Also, that `compgen -v` is a function, at least on Mac zsh.
Apparently in zsh `compgen -v` calls something like
```sh
for var_name in "${(k)parameters[@]}"; do
  printf '%s\n' "$var_name"
done
```
which is the first time I've seen that kind of shell syntax.
It generates a `bad substitution` message in bash 3.2, so I can only assume it's zsh-specific.

That the [`aws_ec2_tag`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/ec2_tag)
resource can be used to add tags to AWS RAM-shared VPCs and subnets:

> This resource should only be used in cases where EC2 resources are created outside Terraform (e.g., AMIs), being shared via Resource Access Manager (RAM), or implicitly created by other means (e.g., Transit Gateway VPN Attachments).

Also, that

> When the source of a module is a version control repository or archive file (generically, a "package"), the module itself may be in a sub-directory relative to the root of the package.
> A special double-slash syntax is interpreted by Terraform to indicate that the remaining path after that point is a sub-directory within the package. For example:
> `git::https://example.com/network.git//modules/vpc?ref=v1.2.0`

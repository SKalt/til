About `IfExists` AWS IAM conditions: if a condition key might not exist (the resource doesn't have it built-in, or a tag isn't set), you can append `IfExists` to the condition test.
For example `StringEquals -> StringEqualsIfExists`.

See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_condition_operators.html#Conditions_IfExists

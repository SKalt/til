That the 14kb limit for fast pages comes from TCP sending 10 initial 1500b packets to guess the amount of bandwidth the client can handle.

I've heard of the 14-15kb limit before, but this was the clearest explanation I'd heard so far of why the limit exists.
Also, the author alleges that the limit applies to http/2 and http/3+QUIC.

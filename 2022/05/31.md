That `sql` has assertions:
```sql
CREATE ASSERTION <Constraint name>
CHECK (search condition)
[ <constraint attributes> ]
```
see https://crate.io/docs/sql-99/en/latest/chapters/20.html#create-assertion-statement.

h/t https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/log/0024/ for bringing that to my attention.

Also, from the weekend: in postgres, at least, you can call `TABLE :table_name;` directly to `SELECT * FROM :table_name;`

That `sql` has assertions:
```sql
CREATE ASSERTION <Constraint name>
CHECK (search condition)
[ <constraint attributes> ]
```
see https://crate.io/docs/sql-99/en/latest/chapters/20.html#create-assertion-statement.

Also, from the weekend: in postgres, at least, you can call `TABLE :table_name;` directly to `SELECT * FROM :table_name;`

Also: how to look up a domain name from an ip:
```sh
reverse_ip_lookup() {
  ip_address="$1"
  dig -x $ip_address +noall +answer
}
```

Also: how to audit AWS VPC flow logs from CloudWatch Log Insights: use the example queries in the right sidebar.

Also: python can execute .zip files directly, like so:
```sh
:; echo 'print("Hello, World!")' > __main__.py
:; zip hello-world.zip __main__.py
:; python3 ./hello-world.zip
## Hello, World!
```

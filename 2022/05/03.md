aws policy documents can change the order of items within permissions arrays, but that's safe to ignore:
- [Order is lost for data `aws_iam_policy_document`](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/issues/11801)
- [Policy elements that are syntactically lists but semantically sets should have their order ignored](https://github.com/jen20/awspolicyequivalence/issues/10)
- [Perpetual diffs / Objects have changed outside of Terraform ](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/issues/23288) tracking ticket

- that `sudo` can be configured with the `visudo` command _and_ that sudo can produce audit logs.
  See https://www.sudo.ws/posts/2022/05/sudo-for-blue-teams-how-to-control-and-log-better/

- that there's an [`Element.closest(selector)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/closest) method, which means you can run this function to set the url to the closest link to an element:
  ```js
  ((el) => {
    let id = el.closest("[id]")?.id
      if (!id) return
    else location.hash = id
  })($0)
  ```

- that you can use
  ```sql
    SELECT /*...*/
    FROM one_table
    JOIN other_table
      USING (common_column)
    ```
    as shorthand for `one_table.common_column = other_table.common_column`.

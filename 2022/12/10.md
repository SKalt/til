That you can include doc-comments in macros:

```rs
macro_rules! documented {
    (
        $(#[$outer:meta])*
        $name:ident
    ) => {
        $(#[$outer])*
        fn $name(&self) {}
    };
}

documented!(
    /// documented
    my_function
);

my_function(); // hovering "function" now shows that the doc-comment is "documented"
```

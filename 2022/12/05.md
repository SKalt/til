That NFC in the context of security keys stands for Near Field Communication: a (usually bluetooth) connection that lets your security key authenticate with a nearby device.

That `git-worktree(1)` is pretty handy! During the process of a refactor, I was able to run

```sh
git worktree add --checkout $local_path $old_branch
```

Explore some deleted/significantly altered files, then inspect the diff between the current and old state of the files!

2: that you can query your cache and index hit metrics ([src](https://blog.crunchydata.com/blog/cleaning-up-your-postgres-database))

3: writes to indexed columns don't necessarily update indices:

> If an indexed column has to have new values inserted, or existing values updated or deleted, the corresponding index does get updated as well. Ironically, that might make queries take more time to evaluate. If write operations are frequently run against a particular column then you may need to more carefully evaluate creating an index here.

In sqlite, all rows have a 64-bit ROWID (with some exceptions). Putting those aside, if you have a single-column integer primary key and use the magic words `PRIMARY KEY INTEGER` then the pkey becomes an alias for rowid, greatly speeding up lookups. I'm not sure how this affects insertions, though.

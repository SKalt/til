That a `go.work` file can point to local "main modules" used for minimum-version selection.
`go` will maintain a separate `go.work.sum` file with the checksums of the workspace's dependencies.
`go work {init,use,edit}` manages the work-files.
`$GOWORK` pointing to a file named like `*.work` can switch between multiple workspace files.
See https://go.dev/ref/mod#workspaces; the syntax of `*.work` files is roughly equivalent to the syntax in `go.mod`.

That none of the following options ensure unused debug info is not included in rust wasm output:

```toml
[profile.release]
opt-level = "z"
lto = true
codegen-units = 1
panic = "abort"
```
Commenting each line and rebuilding with `--target=wasm32-unknown-unknown --release` resulted in 0% change in output .wasm size.
In each experiment, `twiggy garbage ./target/wasm*/release/my_lib.wasm` reported

I cut those sections out using the 2-year-old recipe from https://github.com/Xe/x/blob/c87eb51e0afe78a958eecaffb83318f91c6f78dd/web/mastosan/README.md:

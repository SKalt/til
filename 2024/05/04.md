That a `go.work` file can point to local "main modules" used for minimum-version selection.
`go` will maintain a separate `go.work.sum` file with the checksums of the workspace's dependencies.
`go work {init,use,edit}` manages the work-files.
`$GOWORK` pointing to a file named like `*.work` can switch between multiple workspace files.
See https://go.dev/ref/mod#workspaces; the syntax of `*.work` files is roughly equivalent to the syntax in `go.mod`.

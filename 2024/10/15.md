What an anycast IP is:

> Anycast is a network addressing and routing methodology in which a single IP address is shared by devices (generally servers) in multiple locations.
> Routers direct packets addressed to this destination to the location nearest the sender, using their normal decision-making algorithms, typically the lowest number of BGP network hops.
> Anycast routing is widely used by content delivery networks such as web and name servers, to bring their content closer to end users.

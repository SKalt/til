> In signal processing, the Nyquist rate, named after Harry Nyquist, is a value (in units of samples per second or hertz, Hz) equal to twice the highest frequency (bandwidth) of a given function or signal.
> When the function is digitized at a higher sample rate (see "Critical frequency"), the resulting discrete-time sequence is said to be free of the distortion known as aliasing.

> In [signal processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_processing) and related disciplines, **aliasing** is the overlapping of frequency components resulting from a [sample rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_rate) below the [Nyquist rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_rate).
> This overlap results in [distortion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distortion) or [artifacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(error)) when the [signal is reconstructed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_reconstruction) from samples which causes the reconstructed signal to differ from the original continuous signal.
> Aliasing that occurs in signals sampled in time, for instance in [digital audio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio) or the [stroboscopic effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroboscopic_effect), is referred to as **temporal aliasing**.
> Aliasing in spatially sampled signals (e.g., [moirÃ© patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moir%C3%A9_pattern) in [digital images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_image)) is referred to as **spatial aliasing**.

> Anti-aliasing means removing signal components that have a higher [frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency) than is able to be properly resolved by the recording (or sampling) device.
> This removal is done before (re)sampling at a lower resolution.
> When sampling is performed without removing this part of the signal, it causes undesirable artifacts such as black-and-white noise.
> 
> The anti-aliasing filter essentially blurs the image slightly in order to reduce the resolution to or below that achievable by the digital sensor (the larger the pixel pitch, the lower the achievable resolution at the sensor level).

> **Dot pitch** (sometimes called **line pitch**, **stripe pitch**, or **phosphor pitch**) is a specification for a [computer display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_display), [computer printer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_printer), [image scanner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scanner), or other [pixel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel)-based devices that describe the distance, for example, between dots ([sub-pixels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel#Subpixels)) on a display screen.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_pitch#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_pitch#cite_note-2)

>  In the case of an [RGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model) color display, the derived unit of **pixel pitch** is a measure of the size of a [triad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triad_(monitors)) plus the distance between triads.

That you can use the `.gitmodules` document in the parent repo to configure a
submodule to track a branch with the same name as the parent repo's current branch:

> **submodule.<name>.branch**
>
> [...] A special value of `.` is used to indicate that the name of the branch in the submodule should be the same name as the current branch in the current repository.

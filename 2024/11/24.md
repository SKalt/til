That the GPU I have in the Ubuntu workstation in my office isn't compatible with ROCm, AMD's GPU compatibility layer, or Vulkan.
I was trying to run the binary for [tabby](https://tabby.tabbyml.com/blog/2024/01/24/running-tabby-locally-with-rocm/) locally.
First, I looked up my graphics card:
```sh
; lshw -c video
#  *-display
#       description: VGA compatible controller
#       product: Turks PRO [Radeon HD 7570]
#       vendor: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD/ATI]
#       physical id: ...
#       bus info: pci@0000:01:00.0
#       logical name: /dev/fb0
#       version: 00
#       width: 64 bits
#       clock: 33MHz
#       capabilities: vga_controller bus_master cap_list rom fb
#       configuration: depth=32 driver=radeon latency=0 resolution=2048,1080
#       resources: irq:42 memory:e0000000-efffffff memory:f0020000-f003ffff ioport:e000(size=256) memory:c0000-dffff
```

I followed a few false starts, during which I learned:
- CUDA is more or less NVIDIA-only
- using an incompatible video driver can stall Ubuntu boots :/

These are obvious in hindsight, but here are some of the commands I learned figuring out how I shot myself in the foot:

```sh
grep 'GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX' /etc/default/grub 
sudo vi /etc/default/grub # edit kernel flags
cat /proc/cmdline # display kernel flags in **current** session
update-grub # actually apply edited settings

inxi -G # display graphics hardware
sudo apt install inxi
sudo apt install vulkan-tools
vulkaninfo # display vulkan config.
```

I finally found the smoking gun in [a 2020 wiki post on old GPUs](https://linuxreviews.org/The_Current_State_Of_Older_AMD_Graphics_Hardware_On_Linux:_What_Driver_To_Use_And_What_To_Expect).
Turns out the [7570 came out in 2012](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/amd-radeon-hd-7570-2-gb.b1205#:~:text=Release%20Date,Jan%205th%2C%202012) -- while Vulkan was only standardized in 2016.

This is a bummer, but there's a nonzero chance one of my other salvaged boxes have newer chips.

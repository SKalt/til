that `depends_on: [ service ]` waits for `service` to be **started**, not for `service` to be healthy.

> On startup, Compose does not wait until a container is "ready", only until it's running.
> 
> The solution for detecting the ready state of a service is to use the condition attribute with one of the following options:
> - service_started
> - service_healthy. This specifies that a dependency is expected to be “healthy”, which is defined with healthcheck, before starting a dependent service.
> - service_completed_successfully. This specifies that a dependency is expected to run to successful completion before starting a dependent service.

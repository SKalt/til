(very common) 1. The universal data sink (originally, the mythical receptacle used to catch bits when they fall off the end of a register during a shift instruction). Discarded, lost, or destroyed data is said to have &amp;ldquo;gone to the bit bucket&amp;rdquo;. On Unix, often used for /dev/null. Sometimes amplified as &amp;ldquo;the Great Bit Bucket in the Sky&amp;rdquo;.
The place where all lost mail and news messages eventually go.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://skalt.github.io/til/2024/01/28/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://skalt.github.io/til/2024/01/28/</guid><description>That 401 Unauthorized responses are supposed to include a www-authenticate header with a value indicating how to obtain a valid token.

In metal type, the point size (and hence the em, from em quadrat) was equal to the line height of the metal body from which the letter rises. [&amp;hellip;] In some older texts, but not all, the em is defined, or said to have been defined, as the width of the capital &amp;lsquo;M&amp;rsquo; in the current typeface and point size.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://skalt.github.io/til/2024/01/31/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://skalt.github.io/til/2024/01/31/</guid><description>That SQL implementations with recursive CTEs are Turing-complete!

When the function is digitized at a higher sample rate (see &amp;ldquo;Critical frequency&amp;rdquo;), the resulting discrete-time sequence is said to be free of the distortion known as aliasing.
&amp;ndash; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_rate
In signal processing and related disciplines, aliasing is the overlapping of frequency components resulting from a sample rate below the Nyquist rate.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://skalt.github.io/til/2024/02/12/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://skalt.github.io/til/2024/02/12/</guid><description>That rust has built-in numeric types named like NonZero* that reserve the bit-pattern of 0 as a niche: see https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/num/index.html.
This is useful since that niche will absorb the cost of wrapping a NonZero int with Option:
use core::num::NonZeroU8; use std::mem::size_of; struct Struct&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;{ // has alignment 2, size 4 a: u16, b: T, } fn main() { println!(&amp;#34; NonZeroU8: {}&amp;#34;, size_of::&amp;lt;NonZeroU8&amp;gt;()); println!(&amp;#34; Option&amp;lt;NonZeroU8&amp;gt;: {}&amp;#34;, size_of::&amp;lt;Option&amp;lt;NonZeroU8&amp;gt;&amp;gt;()); println!(&amp;#34; Struct&amp;lt;NonZeroU8&amp;gt;: {}&amp;#34;, size_of::&amp;lt;Struct&amp;lt;NonZeroU8&amp;gt;&amp;gt;()); println!(&amp;#34;Option&amp;lt;Struct&amp;lt;NonZeroU8&amp;gt;: {}&amp;#34;, size_of::&amp;lt;Option&amp;lt;Struct&amp;lt;NonZeroU8&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;()); } # NonZeroU8: 1 # Option&amp;lt;NonZeroU8&amp;gt;: 1 # Struct&amp;lt;NonZeroU8&amp;gt;: 4 # Option&amp;lt;Struct&amp;lt;NonZeroU8&amp;gt;: 4 playground link</description></item></channel></rss>

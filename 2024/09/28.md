That on windows, creating a virtualenv:
1. symlinks executables into `$VIRTUAL_ENV/Scripts` rather than `$VIRTUAL_ENV/bin`
2. only creates a `python.exe` symlink, not a `python3.exe` symlink.

See https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments

Less exciting, but I also (re-)learned that setting a `PYTHONPATH` on windows requires using `;` rather than `:` as the path-separator.

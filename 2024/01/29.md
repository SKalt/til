## Typographic Units

### Absolute distance

| Name   | CSS Unit | length      |
| ------ | :------: | ----------- |
| Picas  |   `pc`   | 1/6 inch    |
| Points |   `pt`   | 1/72 inches |

### Font-relative units

- `em`:

  > In metal type, the point size (and hence the em, from em quadrat) was equal to the line height of the metal body from which the letter rises.
  > [...]
  > In some older texts, but not all, the em is defined, or said to have been defined, as the width of the capital 'M' in the current typeface and point size.
  > [...]
  > In [CSS] the em unit is the height of the font in nominal points or inches.
  >
  > In digital type, the relationship of the height of particular letters to the em is arbitrarily set by the typeface designer.
  > However, as a very rough guideline, an "average" font might have a cap height of 70% of the em, and an x-height of 48% of the em.
  >
  > -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Em_(typography)

  > Font size of the parent, in the case of typographical properties like font-size, and font size of the element itself, in the case of other properties like width.

  > historically the em unit was derived from the width of a capital "M" in a given typeface.

- `ex`:

  > x-height of the element's font.
  >
  > -- [MDN: CSS relative units][mdn-rel]

  > when setting the font-size property using ex units, the font-size equals the x-height of the first available font used on the page.

### Cap height

> Cap height refers to the height of a typefaceâ€™s flat capital letters (such as M or I) measured from the baseline.

### x-height

> X-height refers to the height of the lowercase x for a typeface, and it indicates how tall or short each glyph in a typeface will be.

## Language categories

> For ease of internationalization, Google has categorized languages into three categories: English-like, tall, and dense.
>
> - Tall: Language scripts that require extra line height to accommodate larger glyphs ... like Arabic, Hindi, Telugu, Thai, and Vietnamese.
> - Dense: Language scripts that require extra line height to accommodate larger glyphs but have different metrics from tall scripts.
>   Includes Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.

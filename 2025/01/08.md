That zsh completions in `/usr/share/zsh/vendor-completions` must start with a `_` in order to work, e.g. `/usr/share/zsh/vendor-completions/_rg`. Not sure why, though.

While you can use the same SSH key for both authentication and signing, NIST recommends you shouldn't: https://gist.github.com/ChristopherA/3d6a2f39c4b623a1a287b3fb7e0aa05b

```sh
git config commit.gpgSign true
git config tag.gpgSign true
git config gpg.format ssh
git config user.signingKey 'ssh-ed25519 AAAA...xyz'
```

That mobile OS's often do not define a `$HOME` variable:

```go
	// On some geese the home directory is not always defined.
	switch runtime.GOOS {
	case "android":
		return "/sdcard", nil
	case "ios":
		return "/", nil
	}
```

Side note: hats off to the programmer that called the plural of `GOOS`es "geese".

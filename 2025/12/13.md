> The light-dark() CSS <color> function enables setting two colors for a property - returning one of the two colors options by detecting if the developer has set a light or dark color scheme or the user has requested light or dark color theme - without needing to encase the theme colors within a prefers-color-scheme media feature query.

Also, you can detecte system-level dark mode (and listen for changes) using
```ts
const query = window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)")
const isDark: boolean = query.matches # boolean
query.addEventListener('change', (e): boolean => e.matches)

```

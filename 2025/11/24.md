That there's a "rotate bits left" instruction in all major instruction sets:

- [x86](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/X86_Assembly/Shift_and_Rotate#Rotate_Instructions)
- [ARM](https://armasm.com/docs/bit-operations/shifting/#rotating)
- [WASM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Reference/Numeric/rotl)

Rust exposes this as a safe `const` by-copy method on numeric primitive types:

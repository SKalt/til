That to verify git SSH commit signatures locally, you need to
```sh
git config gpg.ssh.allowedSignersFile $PATH_TO_ALLOWED_SIGNERS_FILE
```
The signers file will be in the form
```txt
user@email.com namespace="git" ssh-ed25519 AAA...jhq user@email.com
```

Once that's set up. you can run
```sh
git log --show-signature
```
To verify signatures locally. Alternately, you can run
```sh
git log --format="signed:%G? fingerprint:%GF key:%GK"
```
See https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log#Documentation/git-log.txt-emGGem for more signature-related log format directives.

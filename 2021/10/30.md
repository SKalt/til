about `terminfo`, the terminal information database: it can be queried to find all kinds of fun facts about your current terminal.
For instance,
- `tput cols` => number of columns in the current terminal
- `tput colors` => number of colors the terminal supports
- `tput setaf` => generate ansi codes to set the foregrount color in the terminal

Also, `infocmp screen` dumps a bunch of other related information drawn from `terminfo`.

about `PATH_MAX`: the part of the POSIX standard which determines the maximum number of bytes allowed in an absolute path.  In Linux, `PATH_MAX` is 4096 [[src]](https://stackoverflow.com/a/9449307/6571327), but it's possible to construct longer paths if you don't care about some (most) utilities that use the current working directory to fail due to buffer overflow.

Also, I learned that [most filesystems restrict file names to 255 bytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_file_systems#Limits).

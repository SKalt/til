That GitHub provides RSS feeds:

> GitHub does offer built-in RSS feeds for certain activities, but they have key limitations:
>
>   - Commits: Only available for a single branch (e.g., main). The URL format is https://github.com/{username}/{repo}/commits/{branch}.atom.
>   - Releases, issues, and pull requests: These have dedicated RSS feeds (e.g., https://github.com/{username}/{repo}/releases.atom), but they don’t include commit details.

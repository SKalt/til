`sqlite3` has a `.import [--csv] [--skip 1] FILE [TABLE]` meta-command ([docs](https://sqlite.org/cli.html#importing_files_as_csv_or_other_formats)).
Also, for some reason my version of `sqlite3` doesn't respect any flags.

Also, `sqlite3` has a `.dump` meta-command that out puts pure SQL (plus a few sqlite `PRAGMA`s): [docs](https://sqlite.org/cli.html#converting_an_entire_database_to_a_text_file)

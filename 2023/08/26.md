That sometimes ssh sessions with x-forwarding don't unlock the GNOME "login" keyring.
This can lead to "Cannot create an item in a locked collection" errors.
The way to fix the problem is to:

```sh
printf "password: "
read -s password
printf "%s" "$password" | gnome-keyring-daemon --replace --unlock
```

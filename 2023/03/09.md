This was a bit of a rollercoaster morning:
(1) I tried `git worktree add $branch`, and it was pretty convenient!
(2) until I got a pre-commit error, then I got `error: unable to read $HASH` on `git status`
(3) which led me to discover `git fsck --full --name-objects`, which is currently yelling about `error: $HASH: invalid sha1 pointer in cache-tree`

To add JSON schema validation to e.g. Cargo.toml files in VSCode using `tamasfe.even-better-toml`, you can add a special comment:

```toml
#:schema https://json.schemastore.org/cargo.json
# see https://taplo.tamasfe.dev/configuration/directives.html#the-schema-directive
```

That there's such a thing as "canadian compilation":

> If build, host, and target are all the same, this is called a **native**.
> If build and host are the same but target is different, this is called a **cross**.
> If build, host, and target are all different this is called a **canadian** (for obscure reasons dealing with Canadaâ€™s political party and the background of the person working on the build at that time).

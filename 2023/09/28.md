> Executables, dynamic libraries and debug companions on all Apple platforms use the _Mach Object_, or short _Mach-O_, container format.
> This applies to iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, watchOS, and macOS.
>
> - Executables do not carry a file extension.
>   For desktop applications, they are often placed in app bundle structures with the .app suffix.
>   Unless stripped manually, executables contain unwind information and a symbol table.
>   Debug information is never stored in executables.
> - Dynamic Libraries use the .dylib extension, and otherwise behave exactly the same as executables.
> - Debug Companions are placed in a folder structure with the `.dSYM` extension, and are located at `<name>.dSYM/Contents/Resources/DWARF/<name>`.
>   They usually contain a symbol table and debug information, but rarely unwind information.

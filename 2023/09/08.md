(1) that gnu [`ld`](https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs-2.41/ld/Options.html), part of gnu's binutils suite, is the de-facto standard interface for linker CLIs.
Thus, all of [`gold` (elf-only `ld`)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_(linker)), [`mold`](https://github.com/rui314/mold/blob/main/docs/mold.md#gnu-compatible-options)/[`sold`](https://github.com/rui314/mold/blob/main/docs/mold.md#gnu-compatible-options), and [`lld`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/lld/docs/ld.lld.1#L26) also try to expose `ld`-compatible CLIs.

(2) that `ld` has several modes of adding a build id to an executable:

> `--build-id[=style]`
> 
> [Create a ] `.note.gnu.build-id` ELF note section or a `.buildid` COFF section.
> The contents of the note are unique bits identifying this linked file.
> `style` can be 
> - `uuid` to use 128 random bits,
> - `sha1` to use a 160-bit SHA1 hash on the normative parts of the output contents, 
> - `md5` to use a 128-bit MD5 hash on the normative parts of the output contents, or 
> - `0xHEXSTRING` to use a chosen bit string specified as an even number of hexadecimal digits (`-` and `: `characters between digit pairs are ignored).
> 
> If `style` is omitted, sha1 is used.

`lld` adds a `--build-id=tree` style as an alias for `--build-id=sha1`, and an extra `--build-id=fast` style. 

 `mold` add a `--build-id=sha256` style and defaults to that.

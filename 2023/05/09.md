About the precedent for deriving `serde` from serialize/deserialize:

> A _codec_ is a device or computer program that encodes or decodes a data stream or signal.
> Codec is a portmanteau of coder/decoder.
> In electronic communications, an _endec_ is a device that acts as both an encoder and a decoder on a signal or data stream, and hence is a type of codec.
> Endec is a portmanteau of encoder/decoder.

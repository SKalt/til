I guessed that not all data centers were created equal, but I hadn't heard of an official ranking system before now.

Apparently [the Uptime Institute](https://uptimeinstitute.com/) provides international rankings of trustworthiness based on uptime guarantees, redundancy, security measures, etc.

The tiers of data centers:

>    **Tier 1**: A data center with a single path for power and cooling, and no backup components. This tier has an expected uptime of 99.671% per year.
>
>    **Tier 2**: A data center with a single path for power and cooling, and some redundant and backup components. This tier offers an expected uptime of 99.741% per year.
>
>    **Tier 3**: A data center with multiple paths for power and cooling, and redundant systems that allow the staff to work on the setup without taking it offline. This tier has an expected uptime of 99.982% per year.
>
>    **Tier 4**: A completely fault-tolerant data center with redundancy for every component. This tier comes with an expected uptime of 99.995% per year.

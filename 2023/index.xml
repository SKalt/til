Unlike regular triggers, which are attached to a single table and capture only DML events, event triggers are global to a particular database and are capable of capturing DDL events. Like regular triggers, event triggers can be written in any procedural language that includes event trigger support, or in C, but not in plain SQL.

[Directory] entries are arranged hierarchically in a tree that is structured geographically and organizationally. Global entries, such as countries/regions, reside at the top of the tree, followed by state or national organizations, then organizational units, people, devices, or anything else that might be represented in a directory.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://skalt.github.io/til/2023/01/17/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://skalt.github.io/til/2023/01/17/</guid><description>that you can set PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 to prevent python from writing pycs (see https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE)

This is needed because Nix flakes respects gitignores. If you don&amp;rsquo;t add things to the git staging area, git doesn&amp;rsquo;t know about the files at all, and Nix flakes can&amp;rsquo;t know if it should ignore them. &amp;ndash; https://xeiaso.net/blog/nix-flakes-go-programs

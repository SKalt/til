SPF (Sender Policy Framework) records are DNS TXT records like `v=spf1 _include=${email_server_domain} ~all`.
SPF records help email servers verify that another email server is allowed to send messages from a domain (e.g. `foo@domain.com` should only be sent by servers listed in an SPF record on a DNS server with authority over `domain.com`).

DKIM is another TXT record that issues public keys to check signature headers in email:

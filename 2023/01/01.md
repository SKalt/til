The difference between triggers and event triggers in postgres:

> Unlike regular triggers, which are attached to a single table and capture only DML events, event triggers are global to a particular database and are capable of capturing DDL events.
> Like regular triggers, event triggers can be written in any procedural language that includes event trigger support, or in C, but not in plain SQL.

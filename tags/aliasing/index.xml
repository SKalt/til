When the function is digitized at a higher sample rate (see &amp;ldquo;Critical frequency&amp;rdquo;), the resulting discrete-time sequence is said to be free of the distortion known as aliasing.

In signal processing and related disciplines, aliasing is the overlapping of frequency components resulting from a sample rate below the Nyquist rate.</description></item></channel></rss>

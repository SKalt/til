describes a directory service as a document database optimized for searches of a hierarchical (directory) tree.</p><blockquote><p>[Directory] entries are arranged hierarchically in a tree that is structured geographically and organizationally. Global entries, such as countries/regions, reside at the top of the tree, followed by state or national organizations, then organizational units, people, devices, or anything else that might be represented in a directory.</p><p>A directory entry is represented by its entry name, or <strong>relative distinguished name (RDN), and by its distinguished name (DN)</strong>. The DN uniquely identifies each entry on a global level, and is derived by concatenating the RDN of an entry with the RDN of each of its ancestor entries.</p><p>The LDAP API provides functions that allow LDAP client applications to search for and retrieve information from an LDAP directory server &mldr; <strong>There are also [LDAP APIs] that provide access control for servers</strong>, by allowing clients to authenticate themselves.</p></blockquote><ul><li><a href=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/ldap/example-code-for-establishing-a-session-without-encryption>LDAP doesn&rsquo;t enforce TLS</a> :/</li><li><a href=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/ldap/using-ldap-for-password-authentication></a></li></ul><blockquote><p>Binding is the step where the LDAP server authenticates the client and, if the client is successfully authenticated, allows the client access to the LDAP server based on that client&rsquo;s privileges.</p></blockquote><p>To summarize:</p><ul><li>a directory is an ontological tree of people, places, organizations, and phyiscal things</li><li>LDAP is a protocol for searching a directory</li><li>LDAP is used for access control (password-only authentication) if the human directory entries have passwords as an attribute.</li></ul></article></main><footer><span>Â© 2022-2022 CC BY-NC-SA 4.0</span></footer></body></html>
